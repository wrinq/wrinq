    <p>wrinq is a communication tool that values your privacy. </p> <h3>Private profiles</h3> <p>wrinq will allow you to make your own profiles which will be stored locally in your browser. You can add as much or as little information you want in them. Profiles will be exchanged <strong>only</strong> when you send and accept contact requests. </p> <h3>Private messaging</h3> <p>wrinq will allow you to send private messages to your contacts. By default your messages won't be saved in wrinq's database. The messages you receive will be stored directly in your browser. Likewise the messages you send will be stored in the browser of the receiver. You will have full control over what you want to do with your data. </p> <p>In case you want async messaging ( when your contact is offline ) you can choose to allow wrinq to store and forward your messages.</p> <h3>Private calls</h3> <p>wrinq allows you to make audio/video calls privately to your friends, family and customers over the internet. Once a connection is established between you and and your contact wrinq server relinquishes all control allowing you to talk freely without any kind of monitoring. </p> <h3>Public source</h3> <p>Around 75% of wrinq's source code will be open source. Already I have open sourced <a href="https://github.com/brickcap/wrinqle">wrinqle</a>, a library that allows server to communicate to individual websockets. </p> <p><a href="https://github.com/brickcap/wrinq-front-end">wrinq-front-end</a> is also open source. Between them these two projects form the crux of wrinq. </p> <p>Remaining 25% of would be the code related to authentication and c.r.u.d stuff. This would also contain credentials of the server where wrinq will be hosted which is why it will be closed. </p> <h3>Open technology</h3> <p>Wrinq is based upon open source technologies </p> <ol> <li>The server is written in erlang, cowboy.</li> <li>The database used is couchDb</li> <li>On client side web rtc is used for audio/video and data communication. </li> </ol> <h3>Reasonable pricing</h3> <p> You can buy the service for </p> <ul> <li><p>3 months ($3)</p> </li> <li><p>6 months ($5)</p> </li> <li><p>1 year ($9)</p> </li> </ul> <p>If you like the idea of wrinq please <a href="http://twitter.com/getwrinq">follow</a> it on twitter. Wrinq will launch sometime in January next year. Thank you for reading. </p>
