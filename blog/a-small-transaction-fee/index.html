	<div><p>So you have read about wrinq and found that you can probably use it 
to manage your rent. There is just one tiny problem. You don't know what it costs. 
The phrase "a small transactional" fee does not help you much. I can probably 
guess what you are thinking right now. </p>
<p>"A small transactional fee eh? 
A good way to say I will charge you as much as I want" </p>
<p>I don't blame you. But when I say "a small transaction fee" I really mean it. </p>
<p>"OK so exactly how small is it?"</p>
<p>I am glad you asked. 
First of all the transaction fee of wrinq is in the same currency in which you collect rent. </p>
<p>So for instance if you charge a rent of <em>$1013</em> from your tenant you get to take <em>$992.74</em> 
while wrinq gets <em>$20.26</em>. </p>
<p>If you charge <em> RS 1013</em> you get to take <em>RS 992.74</em> while wrinq gets <em>RS 20.26</em>. </p>
<p>I hope you get the picture. </p>
<p>"But my rent is not <em>$1013</em>" </p>
<p>Sure no problem. Given below is a handy calculator wizard that calculates how much rent you get and how much wrinq gets. 
Simply enter your rent in the text field and it will do the rest. Play around with it :)</p>
<input id="trent" name="rent" value="" placeholder="1250" required="" type="text">

<p>You get:  <span id="you">1226</span></p>
<p>We get: <span id="me">24</span></p>
<p>Oh and by the way  wrinq is absolutely free to use. We only get paid when you collect your rent :) 
So don't worry about paying any upfront fees.  Sign up, automate your rent collection and relax. </p>
