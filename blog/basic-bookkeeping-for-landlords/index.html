	<h3>Basic bookkeeping for landlords</h3>
	<span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma</span>
	<div><p>We've already talked about the importance of <a href="/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-rental-accounts">keeping rental accounts</a> by the landlords. But we never really discussed what goes into a record book. A record book, a ledger 
or an account whatever you may call it is basically a log of financial transactions between a landlord and 
a tenant. A tenant agrees to pay a certain sum of money in exchange of utilizing your property for living. The absolute minimum that every record book should contain therefore is a log of payments made by the tenant to you. Suppose your tenant 
pays you $1275 for the month of June. Here is what a record book may look like:-</p>
<pre><code>Rent    Due Date    Paid On        Tenant Name
$1275    3 Jun 2013    5 Jun 2013    Margret Blaine</code></pre>
<p>Simple right? All there is to this record is the rent to be paid, the due date, the actual date when the rent is paid and the name of the tenant. This is the record that goes into your books. You also need to issue a rent slip (or a quittance) to Margret as an acknowledgement that the rent has been received by you. Here is what a rent slip might look like. </p>
<pre><code>Date: 5 June 2013
Received $1275 from Margret Blaine 
as the payment of rent for the month of May 2013. 
From: 3 May 2013    To: 3 Jun 2013 
Thanking you, your landlord,
 Shelly Robert.</code></pre>
<p>Again pretty simple right? So a rent slip serves as an acknowledgement to Margret that the rent has been received 
by you. Again the absolute minimum information required for a rent slip is:- </p>
<ol>
<li>The name of the tenant</li>
<li>The name of the Landlord</li>
<li>The amount received.</li>
<li>The period for which the rent has been received.</li>
</ol>
<p>You print this out and give one copy to your tenant and keep one for yourself. But how do you represent dues in your books. Well different landlords have different preferences for this. Some prefer to issue a rent slip with the due amount that will be payable next month. Where as some landlords mark the due amount in the books and issue a slip only when the due has been paid. Personally I prefer to keep the dues in the books. Why? The purpose of a rent slip is to release the tenant from the obligation of paying the rent for that period. So I prefer to issue a rent slip only when the entire payment has been made in full. Here is how you can maintain dues for a tenant in your books :- </p>
<pre><code>Rent    Due Date    Paid On        Tenant Name    Due
$1275    3 Jun 2013    5 Jun 2013    Margret Blaine    $25
$1325   3 July 2013    1 Jul 2013    Margret Blaine    $00</code></pre>
<p>So for the month of June Margret had a due of $25 on the rent of $1300. She pays $1325 the next month which covers not 
only the rent for that month but also the the due left from the previous month. Now she has no dues left. So to represent dues you simply add another column to your books that contain the amount due for that month.  Besides these common fields some landlords also prefer to record the the cheque number in case the rent is is paid by the cheque in case they might need to reference it later.  </p>
<p>These records taken one at a time month by month are pretty simple simple to maintain. You have to record a couple of fields and then repeat the same thing again the next month. Problems start to arise when you have to perform calculations on these records. A due for a single month is carried forward to the next month where it might be paid or be carried further. In such a case you will have to manually look first at the payments of the last month, then create an entry for the present month. And if you have say 2,3 or 5 tenants then your books get complex very quickly. </p>
<p>Then there is the problem of organizing and safe keeping of your books. How do you organize records for extended periods of time. Do you create a new page for each tenant? Or do you create a separate page for every month? Then can you easily calculate your total earnings for the year?  Organizing a rent book and classifying the records based on period and the tenant can be quite a task and if undertaken manually this can lead to human errors. </p>
<p><strong>What about excel sheets?</strong></p>
<p>Excel sheets are a good solution for safe keeping of records. Since everything is digital you can easily back up your data. For a long time I created excel sheets for a few of my landlord friends. But while it is okay for small amount of data, it starts to feel disorganized when the volume increases month by month over a couple of years. Plus as good as excel is it is still manual data entry. </p>
<p>Bookkeeping is one of those areas where you should <a href="/blog/why-would-you-want-to-streamline-your-property-rental-business">streamline</a> your business. Renting your property is not a typical business. Both you and your tenant have a busy schedule. Where you are busy advertising your un rented property, meeting with new tenants, doing the paperwork etc your tenant is busy with their job, children and other things. When you and your tenant meet you wouldn't want to talk about this month's rent or last month's dues now would you? You would want to talk about each other. Are they comfortable in your house? Are you comfortable in having them in your house? And would they want to come to birthday party of your daughter next week? This is what it's all about it is still business but one of those rare ones where you get to have a real personal connection with your customer.
