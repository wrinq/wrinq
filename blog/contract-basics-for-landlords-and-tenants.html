	<p><strong>Contract basics for landlords and tenants</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#what_is_a_contract">What is a contract</a></li>
</ol>
<p>When it comes to discussing legal topics one of the most difficult aspects is to
give a formal definition of the topic being discussed. One would want a definition
to cover as much detail about the subject as possible and yet it must be short and to the point.
Therefore with this guide we start with a very simple definition of contracts. Then we examine this
definition in the light of things that we learn as we progress through it with a special emphasis
on contracts formed between landlord and the tenant. </p>
<h3 id="what_is_a_contract">What is a contract?</h3>

<p>&quot;A contract is an agreement enforceable by law&quot;. This definition is quite simple and gives us
two points of discussion right at the start. </p>
<p><em>The agreement</em></p>
<p>An agreement starts with an offer.
An offer to do something or to abstain from doing something. The person making such an offer
is said to be the <em>promisor</em> and the person to whom such an offer is being made is called the <em>promisee</em>.
An offer is therefore a proposal from a promisor to a promisee to do or to refrain from doing some act.</p>
<p>Now when the promisee accepts such a proposal then a promise is formed. Once a promise has
been made there is a consideration or a regard for that promise.</p>
<p>For example: If you are a landlord
and a tenant makes a promise to pay you $5 each month in exchange for living in your property and you accept that promise.
Then the act of paying $5 by the tenant is the consideration for his/her promise. And the act of letting the tenant
live peacefully in your property is the consideration for your promise.</p>
<p>Coming back to the discussion on agreements, every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration
for each other is an agreement. The promises may have classifications like say a reciprocal promise where one party will
fulfill a part of promise when the other party fulfills a part of theirs. The example of landlord and the tenant that
we discussed above is a reciprocal promise. The landlord will let the tenant live in his house as long as the tenant
pays rent to him. Every month both the landlord and the tenant fulfill a part of their consideration to each other.</p>
<p><em>The communication</em></p>
<p>The offer and the acceptance of the offer must be communicated. But the knowledge of the terms of the offer is essential for the acceptance. For example consider an advertisement by a landlord of his property:-</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To let a two bedroom set in sec 14. For more details contact:0000000000</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tenant can not claim an acceptance of the offer unless he first calls the landlord of the number given and gains information about the details of the offer. After knowing the details of the property to be rented the tenant may make an offer to the landlord which the landlord may accept or reject. Similarly when you go to a grocery store to buy vegetables the items on display are not an offer to sell rather you have to make an offer to buy them to a shopkeeper.</p>
<p>An offer may be communicated to the whole world. But once more the knowledge of the offer is necessary if you are to accept it.</p>
<p>Similarly the acceptance of the offer must be communicated before the agreement is formed. Now it is important to note that the acceptance must be communicated to the right person. Taking the example above if A has advertised his property and you call him asking for details about the same and then communicate the acceptance to, say Sir James Paul McCartney (?), then the acceptance is invalid. With such an acceptance no agreement can be formed. You must communicate the acceptance of the offer to the landlord for it to be valid.</p>
<p>There may be a mode of communication. The landlord may accept only the proposals that are sent to him on his email. In these cases it is necessary to follow the mode that is set by the other party. </p>
<h3 id="when-is-communication-complete-">When is communication complete?</h3>
<p><em>The communication of the acceptance is complete when it comes into the knowledge of the proposer.
</em>The communication of the proposal is complete when it comes into the knowledge
of the person who has the power to accept it.
<em>The proposal may be revoked at any time before the communication of it&#39;s acceptance is complete.
</em>The acceptance may be revoked at any time the communication of the acceptance is complete,against the acceptor. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s take the example of the advertisement above and apply the communication scenarios that we discussed. Once the tenant has got all the details of the house by talking with his landlord on the phone:</p>
<ol>
<li>He may make a proposal.</li>
<li>The proposal may be retracted any time before it reaches the landlord.</li>
<li>The landlord may accept the proposal and communicate the acceptance.</li>
<li>The landlord may retract the acceptance before it reaches the proposer.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that the acceptance must be absolute an without condition. If there are conditions in an acceptance then it is not an acceptance but a counter proposal.</p>
<h3 id="a-contract-is-enforceable-by-law">A contract is enforceable by law</h3>
<p>We defined a contract as &quot;An agreement enforceable by law&quot;. We already discussed what constitutes an agreement. Now we will talk about the second part of the definition of a valid contract. It&#39;s enforce-ability by law. For an agreement to form a contract it must be enforceable by law. For example consider this scenario:-</p>
<p>&quot;For a sum of $5000 A hires B to kidnap C. B kidnaps C. A refuses to pay the money agreed upon. Can B go to a court of law and sue A for payment of the sum?&quot;</p>
<p>Not unless kidnapping is legal in that country. What A and B have in this case is an agreement. But this agreement can not be enforced in the court of law and hence B can not sue a for the recovery of payment. The courts usually give a free hand to the parties of the contract to form the agreements as long as those agreements are within the scope of the law.</p>
<p>This means that while a court will enforce a contract which may favour one party over the other  it will not enforce any contract which is against the law of the land. But before we  discuss the enforce-ability of contracts any further let&#39;s fist talk about void and voidable contracts. :</p>
<p><strong>Void and voidable contracts</strong></p>
<p>A contract is voidable if the consent to form a contract is caused by fraud or misrepresentation or undue influence at the option of the party whose consent was so caused. This means that the party on whom the misrepresentation or fraud on undue influence was performed is free to choose whether to enforce the contract or not.  For example consider this scenario:-</p>
<p>&quot;A agrees to let the house to B. A and B enter into a contract which stipulates that the cost of all the small repairs will be borne by B during the time of his stay. The landlord assures him that there are no defects in the house at present. After signing the contract the tenant finds out that the pipes on the roof are leaking. He asks landlord to have the pipes repaired. The landlord refuses and instead asks the tenant to get the pipes repaired. The tenant also refuses.&quot;</p>
<p>Now this is a very tricky scenario. If this case goes to the court the lawyer for the landlord will stipulate that under the contract the tenant is bound to make any repairs to the house. The tenant will contest that the pipes were broken prior to his occupancy and that the landlord had in fact misrepresented the state of the property.</p>
<p>If the court finds that the property was in fact misrepresented then it can make the contract voidable at the option of the tenant. That is the tenant can choose to either end the tenancy and not do the repairs or he may insist to stay and have the pipes repaired by the landlord.</p>
<p><strong>The due diligence</strong></p>
<p>The illustration above gives us an opportunity to expand a bit upon due diligence. When parties are signing a contract it is assumed that before giving a consent they perform their due diligence with regards to the object of the promise.</p>
<p>In the above example it will be assumed that the tenant before agreeing to rent the landlords house the tenant satisfied himself that there are no defects. And that he had no means of knowing that the pipes were leaking before he actually started using them. And on using them he found that the landlord had not informed him of defective pipes and has also refused to repair them.</p>
<p>If on the other hand the defect would have been something more easily discover able like a crack in the wall of the dining room that the tenant could have seen just by walking into the house then it will not be considered a misrepresentation by the landlord and the repair of the wall will have to be done by the tenant.</p>
<p>The damage to the property is one of the major causes of contention among the landlords and the tenants. And in some countries there is a practice of &quot;Entry condition report&quot;. An entry condition report contains a record of every detail of the property which serves as an evidence in case a dispute arises between a landlord and a tenant.</p>
<p>Secondly the consent has to be given without any duress or outside influence. If it is found that the consent is force then again the contract becomes voidable at the option of the party who gives such a consent.</p>
<p><strong>void contracts</strong></p>
<p>Void contracts are ones which will not be enforced under any circumstance. Where as in voidable contracts the party is given an opportunity to either enforce the contract or make it void, in void contracts there is no such choice. A contract which is void can not be enforced under any circumstance. </p>
<p>An agreement is void if:-</p>
<ol>
<li>If considerations and objects are unlawful in part.</li>
<li>An agreement without consideration is void unless it is in writing.</li>
<li>Agreement in restraint of marriage or trade or legal proceedings are void.</li>
<li>Agreements are void for uncertainty.</li>
<li>Agreements by wager are void.</li>
<li>Agreement contingent of impossible events are void.</li>
</ol>
<p>A contract with a minor is void. But in some countries a minor may enter into residential tenancy contracts where they are bound to pay rent to the landlord in exchange for living in their homes. Generally the landlords in these countries ask for a guarantor who is to pay the rent if the minor is unable to do so.</p>
