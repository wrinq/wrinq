	<h3>It&#39;s about  convenience</h3>
	<span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma</span>
	<div><p>A business sells not just the product but the convenience that the use of his product brings to the users. You are in the business of renting your property. When a potential tenant comes to looking for a place to say she/he evaluates the benefits that renting your house will bring. </p>
<p>Is it close to the market? </p>
<p>Will it be a short commute to the office/college?  </p>
<p>are the questions that a potential tenant is going to ask himself/herself while making of decision to rent your property. You can't change the location of the house or make it any closer to your prospect's place of work but you can make it easy for them to pay their rent. </p>
<p>Collection of rent is one problem that you don't event think about. It rarely crosses your mind that a tenant can view paying rent in cash as a major inconvenience. Well you'd be surprised to know that they do in fact consider it an inconvenience. Recently we conducted a survey in which <strong>72% of the tenants preferred to pay their rent via credit/debit card</strong></p>
<p>It's not really hard to understand why though. We go out shopping for new clothes and how do we prefer to pay for it? Do you like to pay for it in cash or by your credit card?  Now put your self in the shoes of your tenant. The person is used to pay for the goods and services digitally and he comes to rent your house where you tell him in flat terms "We only take cash!" or worse "Can you deposit the money in my bank account please?"</p>
<h3>It's about courtesy</h3>
<p>Most businesses add multiple payment options as a courtesy to their prospect. People don't like parting with their money easily so when customer finally makes a decision to spend they make sure that they provide them with their preferred way of spending it. </p>
<p>I would like to pay with a cheque. Sure.</p>
<p>I want to pay in cash. Go ahead.</p>
<p>Do you accept credit cards? Yes we do!</p>
<p>Offering up alternate methods of payment as a courtesy can make your property look more attractive to your tenants. They might agree to pay more rent to you. You might find the vacancy period for your property shortened.  </p>
