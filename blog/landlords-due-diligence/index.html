	<h3>Landlord&#39;s due diligence</h3>
	<span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma</span>
	<div><p>In many cases the disputes between the landlord and the tenant are
over matters that can be easily resolved (or even avoided all together) by 
the presence of a <a href="/blog/the-importance-of-a-rent-contract/">valid contract</a>. Matters likely to cause disputes like-:</p>
<ol>
<li>Who bears the cost of repairs?</li>
<li>How the water/electricity bill is to be split?</li>
<li>When and by how much the rent will be increased? </li>
</ol>
<p>are among the most common clauses in a rent agreement. And yet over and over again landlords 
fail to enter into a contract before renting their property. Although the disputes start over trifles they can escalate rather quickly. </p>
<p>There was this case where a landlord asked his tenant to pay a 
percentage for the repairs of the blown fuse. When the 
tenant refused the landlord responded by cutting his water supply. 
The tenant then appealed to the court to restrain the 
landlord from obstructing his peaceful use of the property. 
The court complied by giving the order in his favour. 
Needless to say that the relations between the landlord 
and the tenant for the remainder of his stay  were sour. 
A matter that started from a petty "who pays the bill" 
issue transformed into a battle of wills and ended up going to the court.</p>
<p>One of the most important benefits of a contract between the tenant and a landlord is that it clearly 
lays down the responsibility of both the parties towards each other. Yes landlord is responsible for the 
upkeep of the property but to what extent? Yes a tenant should be liable to pay for damages in case 
of negligence. And yes small repairs should be borne by the tenant, after all he is the one using 
the property. These things are in principle fair and just but without a contract they are meaningless. 
In presence of a contract disputes over matters like these melt away simply by reminding the other party 
what was agreed upon before the property was let in. Effective, painless and civil. </p>
<p>Similarly keeping rental account books is one of those areas where landlords are unenthusiastic. I agree 
that it is repetitive[1] but it's worth it. A well kept log of rent collection is a record of late payments, 
default on payments and proof that you have indeed let your property. Suppose you have a tenant that 
is a long time defaulter and you would like to evict him. What do you think is one of the most important pieces 
of evidence that you can produce to support your claim? Yes that's right it's the account books. </p>
<p>Tenant laws are generally protective of the tenants against the landlords. Possibly due to the fact that 
in the old days landlord used to interfere considerably in the peaceful use of the rental property. But one 
area where the law goes to great length is in enforcing the right of the landlord to collect the rent on 
his property. In case of default it can be used as grounds for eviction. It is one of the best ways to 
protect your property. </p>
<p>I suppose that when you are conducting business some kind of attrition can't be avoided. But you can certainly take 
steps to minimize the causes of trouble. So if you do your due diligence. If you verify your tenants or take help of agents to verify them for you. If you enter into a contract and 
<a href="/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-rental-accounts/">if you keep your accounts</a> 
you can ensure not only a healthy business but also claim protection from law against tenants who are a nuisance. </p>
