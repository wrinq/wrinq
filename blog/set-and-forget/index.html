	<div><p>Wrinq was designed keeping one core principle in mind. To keep your 
engagement with the application as low as possible. Why? Because your time is 
important and you have better things to do than check your account every day. </p>
<p>How do we plan to keep your engagement low? </p>
<p> We will do this by notifying you periodically of your account status instead of you having you stop by and check. 
So here is what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>You create your account on wrinq</li>
<li>You give us the details of your tenants like the amount of rent to collect and the date on 
which it is to be collected. </li>
<li>Two days before the due date we send a notification to your tenant's email that the rent is due. </li>
<li>Once the rent is paid we send an email notification to you that includes the details of the 
current month's rent as well as a summary of profits for previous months. </li>
<li>You are also given an opportunity to enter your expenses (like any maintainence costs, repairs etc) that 
will help you calculate your profits and allow you to see where you are spending most money 
so you can then adjust your rent. </li>
<li>That's it. Relax untill next month :) </li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>one and only</strong> goal of wrinq is to make your life as a landlord easier. </p>
