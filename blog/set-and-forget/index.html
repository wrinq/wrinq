	<div><p> wrinq is designed to keep your engagement with the application as low as possible.</p>
<p>Why would we want to do that? </p>
<p>Because we believe that your time is 
important and you have better things to do than check your account every day. </p>
<p>How do we plan to keep your engagement low? </p>
<p>By notifying you periodically of your account status instead of having you stop by and check. Yes for the first time 
you will have to configure wrinq but once you have done so you 
can be assured that wrinq will automate your rent collection and bookkeeping for you. </p>
<p>Here is how this works:-</p>
<ol>
<li>You create your account on wrinq</li>
<li>You give us the details of your tenants like the amount of rent to be collected and the date on 
which it is to be collected. </li>
<li>Two days before the due date we send a notification to your tenant's email that the rent is due. </li>
<li>Once the rent has been paid we send an email notification to you that includes the details of the 
current month's rent as well as a summary of profits for previous months. </li>
<li>You are also given an opportunity to log your expenses (like any maintenance costs, repairs etc) that 
will help you calculate your profits and allow you to see where you are spending most money 
so you can then adjust your rent. </li>
<li>That's it. Relax until next month :) </li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong>one and only</strong> goal of wrinq is to make your life as a landlord easier. </p>
