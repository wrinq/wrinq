	<h3>The gap between property search engines and real estate agents</h3>
	<span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma</span>
	<div><p>I spend time with a lot of real estate agents. A few of them are my friends and often over 
lunch our conversation turns to property search engines. They don't deny their usefulness 
they even like it but all of them are unequivocal in their opinion that selling property is 
still a boots on the ground business. </p>
<p>They say that while real estate search engines are good for getting new clients in, 
the core of the business still comes from the people they know, the people they have 
worked with and the people that have recommended them. It so happens that an agent helps Mrs. 
kitty to move into a new home and Mrs kitty, quite satisfied with her accommodation,
recommends the agent to her friend who is also looking for a new house and the agent knows 
a Mrs Sheldon who is looking for a new tenant and he sets a meeting between two. </p>
<p>The role of property search engines is limited only to help them find Mrs kitty in the first place. 
A good agent for the most part is busy servicing his existing clients or their referrals to worry about the searching for new  ones.  And I have observed that they have not limited themselves to "finding homes". </p>
<p>An agent today is more diversified. Finding a new home is just a small portion 
of the services offered by them. They help with the initial screening. 
They help people move in, settle down. They help them 
with their contracts, agreements and the paperwork. They act as mediators and help in resolution 
of disputes. And they do this with every tenant and landlord they work with. </p>
<p>A good agent might just be the difference between 
your property being rented or left vacant. They represent 
you and vouch for you. And to someone who does not know you in person that's all that matters. </p>
<p>On social media I see that many real estate agents have formed associations where 
they freely exchange notes on how the landscape in property is changing. 
They give talks, write articles and educate people about the relevant laws in their area. They come across as knowledgeable, trustworthy and 
someone who will provide their clients a very personalized service. </p>
<p>Contrast this with the way big property search engines conduct their business. They openly advertise 
terabytes of property listings. Which looks impressive, I admit, but they fail to provide a human face on their offering. 
A whole lot of effort goes into converting that first contact into some one you will let your 
house to. And this effort can not be automated by any computer program. This is where I feel that 
a gap exists that can only be filled by real estate agents. </p>
<p>I am well aware that there is a  whole other side to the story with scummy agents who cheat both the landlord and 
the tenant. But that is true of any business. You will always find people who will not hesitate take advantage of you. 
But if you are a landlord or a tenant who has to change houses frequently you could do much worse than to cultivate 
a relationship with a good agent. </p>
