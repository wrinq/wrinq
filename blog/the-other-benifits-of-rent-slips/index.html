	<h1>The other benifits of rent slips</h1>

	<div><p>I already talked about <a href="http://www.wrinq.com/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-rental-accounts">the importance of keeping your rental accounts</a> before. Issuing timely rental slips forms an important part of keeping the accounts by any landlord. But there is more to the significance of rental slips than it just being a log of your earnings.  </p>
<h3>Importance of rental slips for the tenants</h3>
<p>For the tenants the significance of rent slips is obvious. The rent slip for a tenant is a proof that the due amount has been paid in full to the landlord. This protects the tenant against landlords who may claim that the rent has not been paid. In some countries, my own (India) included, rent slips may qualify a tenant for income tax reductions. So at the end of the year they may save themselves a decent amount of money if they are able to produce the rent slips. A rent slip may also be used as a proof that the tenant utilizes such and such property of landlord in return of paying a rent to him. </p>
<h3>Importance of rental slips for the landlords</h3>
<p>For landlords there are some hidden implications of a rent slip. The law may vary from country to country but here in India when you have let your property to a person you are in possession of the said property through that person. That is you are in an indirect possession. This fact can have some legal bearing in certain situations. For instance in case of trespassing or breach of possession you may have to produce your tenant in the court and have him acknowledge that you are indeed the master of the property and you have a right to defend it against any harm. A rent slip and or a contract can in this situation help your standing. </p>
<p>Another legal implication arises when you decide to sell your property while the tenant is still residing in your property. Since a contract exists between two persons when you sell your property to another it nullifies the contract that you had with your tenant. So a tenant might refuse to pay the previously fixed rent to the new master and it may lead to a dispute. Having a rent slip ensures that when the new landlord forms a new contract with the tenant he get him to pay at least the same rent that was fixed with the previous landlord. In this case a rent slip strengthens your bargaining position. Refusal to pay the fixed rent can then be considered grounds for eviction.  </p>
<p>Legal implications aside having a record of your financial dealing makes the life easier for you as a landlord or as a tenant. It is such a simple thing to do and it can save you much trouble if you make it a habit to keep record all your rent collections. </p>
