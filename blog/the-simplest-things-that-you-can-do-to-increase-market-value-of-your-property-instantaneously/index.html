	<h3> Simple things you can do to increase market value of your property</h3>
	<span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma</span>
	<div><p>As a landlord one of things you are responsible for is the marketing of your property. While the old adage "Location, location,location" is  still one of most important factors that prospective tenants take into account when choosing a property, sadly it is also the something that you can do nothing about. You can't really change the location of your property. So how do you stay relevant in the market? How do you attract better tenants to your property?</p>
<p>First focus on the basics. Make sure that your property is well maintained. Fix any broken pipes, repair any cracks and make sure that your property is in tip top condition. If you are renting furnished homes spend a few days decorating your offering according to the tastes of the tenants that you are trying to attract. Remember that if you can appeal to their likes you are one step closer to closing the deal.</p>
<p>Second get in touch with property agents. While it is nice to advertise on the property websites, when it comes to actual sale a <a href="/blog/the-gap-between-property-search-engines-and-real-estate-agents">real person is much more effective</a>. When a prospective tenant is searching for a property online if your offering does not match the location filter, he has set while searching for homes, he probably won't even see your property. Real estate agents are much more proactive than a property search engine. They don't wait for the tenant to stumble upon your property by accident. Instead they reach out and make a prospect aware of your offering.</p>
<p>Sure it is still quite possible that the prospect passes on. But reaching out to people has the added advantage of forming a connection. Maybe he knows some other person who is looking for what you are offering. All this would not have been possible if you had stopped at just submitting your property to a property search engine. </p>
<p>Third make it easy for your tenants to pay rent to you and easier on yourself to <a href="/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-rental-accounts">keep books</a>. Credit cards these days are being used everywhere. Any shop you go to whether to buy clothes or groceries accepts credit cards.  Why is that? Think about it for a moment. They want to make paying your bills as easy as possible. Bought that new pair of blue suede shoes from a fancy shop-- The cashier says smoothly:</p>
<p>"Very good sir! just swipe your card here and you can take them home".</p>
<p>Now would it not be great if your tenants could pay you your rent simply by swiping their credit card? And what to know something else. Imagine how easy it will be book keep for those tenants who pay their rent online. Everything will be automatic. Easy for you. Easy for your tenant. </p>
<p>If you do these things. If you keep your property well maintained. If you let real estate agents sell your offering and if you can make it easy for your tenants to pay their rent to you then you will have no trouble finding <strong>quality</strong> tenants for yourself no matter where your property is situated. </p>
