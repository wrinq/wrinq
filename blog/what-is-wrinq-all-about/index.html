	<h1>What is wrinq all about?</h1>
	<span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma</span>
	<div><p>The idea behind wrinq is simple. It is built to help you collect your rent 
on time from your tenants. That is all there is to it. 
But the question is why would you need a an online service to do that for you? 
Is it not much simpler to do it all yourself? </p>
<p>It is simpler I agree but at times it can be inconvenient. Suppose you collect your 
rent at 5th of every month. And on 6th you bump into your tenant at the park. After 
exchanging civilities you summon up strength to suggest to your tenant that he is 
overdue.</p>
<p>"Oh it's 5th already" </p>
<p>"Well it's actually the 6th"</p>
<p>"Sorry about that. "</p>
<p>"You didn't take your wife shopping did you?" </p>
<p>"Yes I had to buy her some new clothes"  </p>
<p>"I see it must have been heavy on the wallet. You were to go to party if I recall correctly" </p>
<p>"Yeah. Cousin's birthday." </p>
<p>"Wasn't it her cousin's birthday the last month." </p>
<p>"Oh no different cousin. A big family you see. She has many." </p>
<p>"One for every month it would seem" </p>
<p>"Yes..... listen"</p>
<p>And here it comes. You know the usual. </p>
<p>"Would it be okay if I could pay the rent after I get my salary. 
It's only a week". </p>
<p>And you begrudgingly agree. He is a good guy. And good tenants are hard to find.<br>So what if he indulges his wife a bit? He will pay next week no big deal. </p>
<p>The only problem is that you have your wife's cousin's birthday is coming up next week 
and she's been hinting about buying some new clothes. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>It's a psychological thing</strong></p>
<p>Wrinq helps you avoid this situation by making it easy for you to ask for rent 
and making it even easier for your tenant to pay it. To understand how we must look 
at the landlord's and the tenant's psychological behaviour. Yes it is science. Pay attention:- </p>
<p>Put your self in the landlord's shoes. The new month has started and you take out your<br>account register and estimate the 
expenses that you have to cover. Your salary will be deposited 
on the 3rd and if you can get the rent by 5th you can 
easily pay off the bills without ever touching your salary. 
The question is will you get your rent on time. Statistically it's unlikely. So you have 
got to confront your tenant and tell him that he simply must pay on time. But he is 
a nice guy and you don't want to be too pushy with him so you let it slide a couple of 
days and before you know it's 12th and you have already spent in a decent chunk of your own salary 
so you must do your calculations all over again to know how your budget is doing for the month. No it's not that much of 
a problem but it's unpredictable and unmanageable. </p>
<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of the tenant.  </p>
<p>You have some of your last month's salary left with which you could pay rent 
or you could maybe stall it until you get your salary. You don't want to 
part with the money in hand cause you might be able to squeeze in a few unforeseen 
expenses with it and since the rent is always fixed and you can easily deduct it from your salary when you get it. </p>
<p>It would however be a lot more convenient if you could send the money electronically to your landlords account. 
This way it will balance out when your income is deposited in your account and you get to keep 
the cash in hand. </p>
<p>This is where wrinq comes in</p>
<ol>
<li>First it makes it easier for the landlord to ask for the rent by sending an  email 
every month. </li>
<li>It allows the tenant to pay the fixed rental price electronically in an instant. </li>
<li>It sends in a rent slip once the receipt of rent has been confirmed. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Isn't electronic transfer of funds insecure?</strong></p>
<p>Good question. Wrinq uses paypal to transfer funds from the tenant 
(who by the way does not even need a paypal account to make the payment just a credit card) 
directly into your account. Paypal is trusted by millions of businesses around the world to make secure payments. 
So you can be assured that you will get your money. Once the money has been deposited into your account 
you can then transfer it into a bank or use it any other way you want. </p>
<p><strong>Okay but what's with the watermelon juice?</strong></p>
<p>I see you have been to the landing page and you are probably wondering about 
this sentence:- </p>
<blockquote>
<p>see the money flowing into your account while sipping on a 
cool watermelon juice on a sunny afternoon with your loved ones</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am (along with dozens of landlords that I have spoken to) of the opinion that 
you don't want to waste time on collecting rent. You don't want to do manual bookkeeping<br>recording each month how much rent you collected. You don't want to do that even for one of 
your tenants let alone for 3 or 4 across a few properties that you own. </p>
<p>What you want is 
to is to make sure that they pay their rent on time so you can focus on more pressing matters. 
You  want the bookkeeping to be automated so you don't have to record the same old details every month. 
You want the rent slips to be sent automatically so you don't fill in the same form every month. </p>
<p><strong>To put simply you want to streamline your rental business so you can be more efficient and relaxed. Wrinq helps
you do that.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wrinq is a weird name?</strong></p>
<p>Ah I knew you would ask. Actually wrinq is an acronym. </p>
<p><strong>W</strong>ield </p>
<p><strong>R</strong>ent </p>
<p>(<em>and</em>) </p>
<p><strong>I</strong>ssue </p>
<p><strong>N</strong>ormative </p>
<p><strong>Q</strong>uittance. </p>
