	<h3>What we are doing with wrinq?</h3>
	<span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma</span>
	<div><p>We started wrinq with a very clear purpose of simplifying rent collection and bookkeeping for landlords. 
We felt that most people don't take their 
<a href="/blog/why-would-you-want-to-streamline-your-property-rental-business/">property rental business</a> 
seriously. They don't get their tenants verified. They don't issue rent 
slips. They don't even keep books. Their rental business is in a total disarray. Personally I feel very strongly about 
this issue as I have seen first hand the importance of 
<a href="/blog/the-importance-of-keeping-your-rental-accounts">keeping your rental accounts</a>. </p>
<p>So we talked to several landlords and letting agents and pitched to them our idea. We would make a product 
that would allow them to collect their rent via paypal. Their tenants need not have a paypal account 
just a credit card with which they can pay their rent. Every month an email will be sent to the tenant as a reminder. 
On the payment of the rent a rent slip would be mailed to them. The landlord will have the record of all of their 
collections in one place. Wrinq could be used from smart phone. You won't even need to download any additional app to use it. Your default email application will be enough.  Simple and easy.</p>
<p>The response we got was terrific. Nearly everyone agreed that if they had 
a choice they would collect their rent online. The tenants liked the idea of having an option to 
pay their rent via credit card. So we doubled our efforts and for 3 months we programmed wrinq. Last 
month we signed up a few landlords on our platform so that we can show them what we've been up to. </p>
<p>As we expected we got a few things wrong and they were quite helpful in pointing out a better way. For instance 
initially the rent slips were only being emailed to the tenants. It was suggested to us that when mailing 
the rent slips we could <code>cc</code> it so that both the landlord and the tenant got it at the same time. </p>
<p>A feedback that we got from tenants was the ability to see how much rent they've paid and to whom. 
So we also build a screen where tenants can see the their payments and even download rent slips for 
old payments. Later we added the ability for landlords to download their old rent slips directly from 
the application in case they misplaced their email. </p>
<p>As we worked on wrinq further we came across many problems that we hadn't considered. For instance 
many many landlords are unaware of the law. In India, it is required for every landlord to 
get their tenants verified. But hardly any one I know bothers about it. Most people 
don't even sign any kind of agreement before letting their property. </p>
<p>These are the kinds of problem that a web application can not solve. We can help them collect their 
rent. We can help them maintain their books. We can help them send reminders. But we can't do anything to help them 
with their tenant verification. That is we can't do anything by ourselves. For this we need help from letting agents. </p>
<p>Which is why in addition to our core service we are partnering with letting agents to help the landlords on our 
platform with other legal, but very essential aspects of the rental business. 
In addition to service from industry experts we are also writing a very basic guide on contracts with special emphasis on rent agreements. Which among other things should help them answer questions like :-</p>
<p>What does a contract mean? </p>
<p>Why is it necessary for me? </p>
<p>Why do I need a lawyer to draft my contract?</p>
<p>Online rent collection will always be the primary business of wrinq. But we want to improve the lives 
of landlords by making them more aware of the best practices they should follow with their property business. 
We can get best results only when we work very closely with all the people involved. The landlords, the tenants 
and the letting agents. And we plan to do just that :)     </p>
