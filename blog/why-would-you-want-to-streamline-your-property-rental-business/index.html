	<h3>Why would you want to &quot;Streamline your property rental business&quot;?</h3>
	<span>Akshat Jiwan Sharma</span>
	<div><p>One recurring sentence you might have read throughout our website is </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Streamline your rental property business </p>
</blockquote>
<p>and one recurring question that might have come in your mind must have been why? </p>
<h3>"Why would I want to streamline my property rental business?"</h3>
<p>If you have ever had a tenant you probably know that it is not an easy work managing 
them. You are in part responsible for providing  good living conditions for them. That includes taking 
care of repairs, paying the bills, taxes. In addition to this you are also responsible for issuing rent slips indicating the successful payment of rent .Granted that it is not everyday that repairs are needed nor do
you pay the bills frequently but it is still necessary work and it must be done. On the other hand your tenant 
has a duty to pay you the rent on  time.</p>
<p>Then there is the problem account management. As <a href="/blog/what-is-wrinq-all-about">I outlined before</a> 
it is not uncommon for the tenants to ask for a little leniency so that they might pay their rent later perhaps in the next week or maybe in the next month. While it's fine with you it seriously disturbs the accounts. You have to record 
the unpaid rent. Ask for a full payment the next month and then remember to mark the debts as paid. </p>
<p>You should also be keeping a record of how much you are spending each month on maintenance costs, 
electricity bills, water bills etc. These costs help you understand how much profit you are making and consequently they 
will help you determine an optimal rent for your property. </p>
<p>But this is work is tiring for even a single tenant let alone 2,3 or 5. 
Manual bookkeeping is prone to errors. 
It requires focus, time and energy that would be better spent on other more important tasks. 
This kind of repetitive work is what should be automated.  This leads to another question:</p>
<h3>Is it even a business?</h3>
<p>Depends on your outlook. I suppose we can all agree that we consider renting our property as a source of income.
You have a few rooms that you want to let so you can earn money from them. This is our motivation. But we 
don't probably think of it as a business since the profit that we can earn from letting is fixed for a duration of time. 
No matter what you do you the only way to make more money is to increase the price. </p>
<p>However you can still reduce the costs. No not the maintenance costs (those are the price of doing business) 
but the time cost. The time you spend in asking for rent, maintaining the books and calculating expenses is 
valuable. If you automate this aspect you remove friction from your venture. You put in motion a repeatable 
process that will stay the same regardless of who you have as your tenant.  So even if your rent stays the same 
you get more value out of it since you are  <strong>putting in much less effort</strong>. </p>
<h3>What benefit does this way of thinking brings?</h3>
<p>Automating a recurring process offers several benefits </p>
<ol>
<li>It ensures that a given task is performed correctly every time. In our case this means that every month your rent will 
be collected, deposited into your PayPal account, rent slip will be issued to your tenants and books will be updated on your behalf.</li>
<li>It gives you a chance to reflect and see trends that can help you to bring down costs or increase the rent. Well maintained records mean that they be analyzed for opportunities of optimization. Maybe you spend a good amount on renovation 
every new year but were never aware of it since those details were never recorded. Keeping a track of your expenses is the first step in bringing them down. Wrinq prompts you after ever successful collection to record these expenses and then helps you analyze and optimize them. </li>
<li>It gives you an opportunity to better serve your tenant so you can have a pleasant mutually beneficial relationship. </li>
<li>Finally as you accumulate your rental data you will be in a much better position to predict the rent for your next tenant. </li>
</ol>
<p>And this is what we mean when we say "Streamline your rental property business". And like we have said before <strong>The one and only goal of wrinq is to make your life as a landlord easier</strong>.</p>
