	<p><strong>Q</strong>: What do I need to use wrinq?</p>
	<p><strong>A</strong>: Just an email address and a paypal account.</p>
	<p><strong>Q</strong>: Why do I need a paypal account?</p>
	<p><strong>A</strong>: Paypal is the easiest and the most secure way 
	  to send and receive money online. It is trusted by millions of users. Paypal will take care 
	  of processing the money paid by your tenant and then we will direct it to
	  securely deposit it into your paypal account. 
	  After which you decide what to do with it. It is much quicker (instantaneous) than bank transfers and 
	  just as secure. </p>
	<p><strong>Q:</strong> Does my tenant need to have a paypal account</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> No. Your tenant does not need a paypal account. 
	  All that is needed is a way to make online payments. Credit cards/debit cards etc.</p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> How much do you charge me? </p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> wrinq has no sign up fees. You can simply create an account and 
	  start using wrinq for absolutely free. We charge <strong> a small transaction fee</strong>  
	  only when your tenant pays you money. So <strong>we get paid when you get paid</strong>. </p>
        <p><strong>Q:</strong> What if I don't like watermelon juice?</p>
        <p><strong>A:</strong> You don't mean that.... really? You don't like watermelon juice?
